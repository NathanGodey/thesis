        This part studies the representation degeneration phenomenon from various perspectives. We extend the works mentioned in \Cref{chap:rw_repr_ana} by exploring these questions at larger model scales, for other modalities and using different analysis tools. This provides valuable insights towards improving the language modeling paradigm, that we leverage in \Cref{part:solutions}.

        In this part, we leverage the insights provided in \Cref{part:analysis} in various ways and derive methods that mitigate the identifies limitations of the classical language modeling framework. Our approaches yield several benefits in robustness, performance, and efficiency.
