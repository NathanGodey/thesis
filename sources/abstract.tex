The field of Natural Language Processing has recently known a major paradigm shift that has led to significant improvements over the perceived capabilities of resulting systems. This shift, namely the advent of generative systems in the stead of predictive ones, has induced a profound change in the implicit objectives of language systems based on deep learning : where we used to aim at extracting relevant features from text utterances using self-supervision, we now try to maximize the generative performance of language models on tremendous volumes of diversified text samples.

In this thesis, we explore high-level properties of the features (or \textit{representations}) that are extracted by these language models, and we leverage these properties to improve language systems and to quantify their limitations. This work is two-fold, as we first focus on the learnings that result from representation analysis in trained language models, and we then proceed to suggest and implement novel inductive biases and training approaches based on these learnings.

We find that the intermediate representations of self-supervised language models are affected by several forms of biases. First, they suffer from data-inherent biases that can be traced back to socio-cultural considerations, as we demonstrate by probing geographical knowledge in these features. Moreover, we show that these representational spaces can be distorted by the particular nature of language, especially when the dimensionality of the feature space is small. We proceed to show that inductive biases such as self-attention can also induce similar distortions that happen regardless of the target modality. Hence, representation analysis helps us identify limitations that come from distinct aspects of language models, from training data to architecture.

Not only can the prism of representation learning help us identify limitations in language models, but it can also lead to substantial improvements for language systems, especially in terms of efficiency. Aware of the mechanisms that we identified, we propose alternatives to the classical next-token likelihood maximization approach. We design a novel differentiable layer that performs text segmentation to optimize tokenization along with the rest of the system, leading to efficient character-level modeling and robust models. We also implement a contrastive objective that simultaneously alleviates the representational bias induced by token frequency and the degeneration phenomenon by implicitly regularizing the latent spaces using in-batch samples. This objective yields substantial efficiency improvements and better performance. Finally, we [EDINBURGH PROJECT].

Overall, our work proves the relevance of representation analysis in the context of improving language systems.
